      <p>
        In multiplayer games, one-for-one removal spells like Murder fall under
        the same category as one-for-one discard effects. Therefore (although we
        know that the circunstances could make it worth), they may also lead to
        unwanted card disadvantage, making the caster and the targeted
        creature’s controller both lose one card, while the rest of the board
        keeps their resources. This numeric disadvantage that may be avoided,
        among other ways, by the symmetrical effects of Innocent Blood, Fleshbag
        Marauder, Merciless Executioner and Slum Reaper. You may even make it
        repeatable, casting permanents like The Abyss or Magus of the Abyss.
        Your goal is a) to use the noncreature spells when you control no
        creatures, sufficient creatures or even sacrifice-powered engines, or b)
        to deprive your opponents of more expensive and/or menacing creatures
        than the one you’ll lose with the “on a stick” versions. Yet, if your
        objective is to obtain as much real card advantage as possible, with
        numeric consistency, you might want to balance those with some of the
        following options. Targeted removal spells on a stick. Preffering to
        cast creatures with ETB effects rather than their noncreature
        counterparts makes all sense in a format with a higher medium mana
        curve. Keeping a permanent is what makes options like Shriekmaw and Big
        Game Hunter so effective in EDH. If you’re willing to pay a little more
        to cast Overseer of the Damned, you could even extend the advantage by
        getting tokens out of your opponent’s creatures deaths.
