      <p>
        You’ve probably got some legendary creatures in your card collection
        that look like they do something really cool, but you’ve never had a
        deck to put them in. Maybe there’s a creature that showed up in a recent
        prerelease pool that you couldn’t find enough support for. Maybe you
        picked one up in a Conspiracy draft and have been eyeing it ever since,
        wishing it were Standard-legal. Maybe your legendary creature was
        Standard-legal once, and you’ve missed playing with it ever since it
        rotated. That creature can be the commander of your deck. You don’t have
        to start with the commander to build every Commander deck, but it’s a
        good way to begin to define what your deck will do. For example, my
        current favorite commander is Gishath, Sun’s Avatar, which benefits from
        having a lot of other dinosaurs in the same deck. It also includes cards
        like Kinjalli’s Caller and Commune with Dinosaurs that make dinosaurs
        easier to cast early on. Your commander also limits what cards you’re
        allowed to use. The colors of spells in a Commander deck are limited to
        its commander’s color identity, which is determined by the mana symbols
        in the casting cost and ability costs of the commander. For example, you
        can play only black, red, and colorless cards in a Judith, the Scourge
        Diva deck, and you can play cards of any color in a Golos, Tireless
        Pilgrim deck. Golos is colorless, but their activated ability costs
        WUBRG, which makes them a five-color commander.
