      <p>
        While ramping isn't something exclusive to Commander, it certainly is at
        home in a format that's all about big plays and long-lasting games,
        making cards like Cultivate and Kodama's Reach enduring staples. This
        article will focus on ramp through the means of acquiring lands, whether
        to your hand or directly to the battlefield. I'm leaving out artifacts,
        creatures, and other means of generating mana, as this is another topic
        that deserves an article itself. Keep in mind that we're talking about
        casual Commander here; competitive EDH can almost be considered a
        different format. Let's look at these two cards; Rampant Growth and
        Farseek. On first sight, these cards seem to be very similar. The main
        difference is that Rampant Growth can even search a basic Forest, while
        Farseek can find anything but a Forest. However, if we take another look
        at Farseek, it doesn't mention that the land you search must be a basic
        land. This opens the door to many dual lands, including shock lands,
        Battle lands, Amonkhet cycle lands, and other lands that include the
        basic land type. Good ramp spells don't limit us to only basic land
        cards, but rather let us search multicolor mana sources.
