            How many cards are in a MTG Commander deck?: 
            The number of cards in Commander’s super-sized decks and whether your commander counts towards
            the total. Choosing a commander or theme: Tips on picking the best commander in MTG and building
            your deck around a specific play style or theme. MTG Commander deck building ratio: How many 
            lands, creatures and other cards you should include in your Commander deck. What should be in a 
            MTG Commander deck?: Everything else you’ll need in your 100 cards. Improving your MTG Commander 
            deck: How to take your deck from built to brilliant game after game. How many cards are in a MTG 
            Commander deck? A Commander deck is 100 cards and you can’t have more than one of any card that 
            isn’t a basic land. That means it’s a little bit harder to try and optimise than most formats, 
            but that’s also a big part of its charm. Your commander counts as one of those 100 cards, and 
            they start the game in the Command Zone rather than in the deck. The commander also dictates 
            what colours you can use in your deck. If your commander is a Red and White creature, then you 
            can only have Red, White and Colourless cards in your deck. Choosing a commander or theme 
            The first you should do when making any Commander deck is to, well, pick a commander. A commander 
            can be any legendary creature that you like. It can even occasionally be a planeswalker, 
            but only very 
            specific ones, so it’s usually best to just stick to creatures. Actually, it doesn’t always have 
            to be the commander - sometimes it can be a theme or a strategy. Let’s say you know you 
            love dragons but you’re not sure which commander would best suit that love. Well then, you’ve got 
            your theme, so you just need to find a commander. Likewise, sometimes you’ll see a legendary 
            creature you adore but be unsure how to build around them, in that case, you need to find a theme. 
            Sometimes the theme is tribal, like everything being dragons. Other times it’s a strategy - for 
            example, knowing you want to play as many lands as possible or win using an alternate win method, 
            such as milling your opponent so that they lose when they can’t draw any cards. No matter what it 
            is, having a strong core idea to build around is going to make your decks much easier to make. It 
            doesn’t always have to be an obvious one either; sometimes just wanting to play all of the best 
            cards in a mana colour is a good enough idea. That said, the more niche it is, the more fun 
            you’re likely to have - and the more creative you can be with your card choices. A big part of the 
            fun of Commander is in building a deck and finding obscure cards to include. It’s not always about 
            winning.
