        <p>
            Adding ample amounts of card draw into your deck will increase the chances that you'll be able
            to do a lot of important things. You'll be more likely to hit your land drops. You'll be more 
            likely to have the right answer at the right time to your opponents' annoying attempts to do 
            stuff like wipe the board, win the game, or even just steal or lock down your commander. You'll 
            also be more likely to draw into your win condition and just as importantly, ways to protect 
            your win condition. With all else being equal, the more cards you draw the more likely you will
            be to win the game. Blue is the king of card draw, but every color has some ways to get 
            additional cards into your hand. Green often likes to look at the power of your creatures and 
            sometimes even demands that you sacrifice them. Red often requires you to discard as part of 
            the bargain, sometimes giving you card "selection" but not actually card "advantage." Black is 
            the most likely to cost you life and White is just the worst, often having to rely on shutting 
            down an opponent's extra draw in order to get your precious extra cards. There are lots of 
            colorless options, ranging from some of the most powerful cards to old, overcosted rocks that 
            you pay mana into and tap just to draw a card. Card draw looks different in different colors 
            and in different decks.
