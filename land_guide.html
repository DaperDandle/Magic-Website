      <p>
        Every deck needs lands to operate in Commander, and as such, they’re the
        most important part of any mana base. Monocolored decks are fantastic
        for budget players, as they can get away with playing a high number of
        basics. Decks with two colors can do similar, though some number of dual
        lands will help make them more consistent. Any deck with more than two
        colors will usually need more duals to maintain the same level of
        consistency — and thankfully, there are plenty of options! The Battle
        for Zendikar lands (like Prairie Stream) are excellent choices for
        budget mana bases, as they become more useful the more basics you play.
        Amonkhet’s cycling lands (like Scattered Groves) provide great fixing in
        the early game, and they give you a redraw if you top-deck them later
        on. Both of these land types work wonderfully with “check lands” like
        Sulfur Falls, as they have basic land types to let it enter untapped.
        Creature lands have become much more affordable in recent times; they’re
        seeing less play in formats where they were popular, most notably in
        Modern. Celestial Colonnade is the most expensive one still, but it’s a
        fraction of the price it once was. These provide you with two colors as
        well as additional utility, and are a fantastic choice if they’re within
        your budget.
